This module aims to examine the basic concepts and theories of ethics. As a philosophy, ethics attempts to answer life‚Äôs big questions about the conscious examination of man‚Äôs culture and beliefs. It also tackles how important rules to man, which is deemed to be the foundation for a healthy society. It further discusses the issues on moral and non-moral standards - two differing concepts, yet have almost the same analysis about good or bad and right or wrong. Moreover, the students will be aware that life consists of tough choices in life, also called a dilemma. Finally, reason and impartiality are considered as the minimum requirements for morality, as such covers the main issues, i.e. ethics and morality.</p><h1 id="6bf4878d-1685-43ce-b929-e28e884d1af3" class="block-color-blue">2.

This serves as the key to understand the deeper meaning of Ethics.

Ethics can be classified as behavioral and applied.</p><p id="6653833b-bbc9-46eb-aeca-8f35b21862b8" class="">Behavioral ethics pertains to how we behaved when confronted with ethical dilemmas.¬† For example, an employee should show acceptable behavior such as showing respect, taking responsibility, and accountability, and communicating clearly in the workplace in order to contribute quality output.</p><p id="cd7c68a7-5344-49d3-ad4a-afcf67cbf1c0" class="">Applied ethics, sometimes called practical ethics is concerned with practical problems that coincide with moral philosophy which includes subfields such as medical, social, legal, and business ethics.</p><h2 id="83541444-1c60-489d-8976-76729a5a85d3" class="">ETHICS AND MORALITY DEFINED</h2><p id="7864454c-ba1f-42b7-9d59-40ac4026c8bd" class=""><strong>Ethics</strong>¬†is derived from the Greek word¬†<em>Ethicos</em>¬†which means relating to one‚Äôs character, customs, or manners. It is a science of character of an individual expressed as right or wrong conduct or action.</p><p id="867025d6-c171-446b-a14d-e36175346031" class="">Ethics is also related to moral principles that prescribe codes and explain what is good or bad, right or wrong or evil. It tells us how choices are to be made and what the consequences it will yield.</p><p id="3064911b-472b-4074-9731-98fe05977565" class="">In other words, ethics¬†seeks to resolve questions¬†of human morality by defining¬†concepts¬†such as good and evil, virtue and vice, or justice and crime.</p><h3 id="df729bff-fcd9-42ca-ba96-4a64a246d72a" class="">What is Morality?</h3><p id="c66e16f2-ce45-4ac2-b610-c8d431a38751" class=""><strong>Morality</strong>¬†comes from the Latin word m<em>os¬†</em>(normative) and¬†<em>Moris</em>¬†(genitive) meaning <em>customs </em>or <em>conduc</em>t. It refers to what a person ought to do and not to do and are shared and widely accepted as the standard for himself in a wider environment, that is the community or society.</p><p id="ae14c2be-e934-4395-9986-0b1fef19f953" class="">Various concepts as to how we live morally arise from various ethicists, including how they look at the meaning of morality. To start with, let‚Äôs take Rachels definition and example of what morality is. James Rachels, a Philosophy professor (1941-2003) proposes a theory called ‚Äúminimum conception‚Äù of morality. He explains that the core of every moral theory should accept at least a starting point.¬†Rachels (1999) further¬†argued that for a person to be moral, his judgment should¬†be backed up with sound reasoning¬†- a¬†minimum requirement for morality.</p><p id="d6b0335c-24d7-423c-9616-5aa687ca07d5" class="">Here&#x27;s the story of baby Theresa that demonstrates one&#x27;s judgement and moral action. Let us try to read and analyze the case of ‚ÄúBaby Theresa‚Äù as follows.</p><p id="89808893-2744-48b1-b507-73a4235b630b" class=""><em>Baby Theresa was born with a disease called ‚ÄúAnencephalic‚Äù meaning no cerebrum, cerebellum, and the top skull is missing but has a brain stem that keeps her from breathing. In Florida, where Theresa‚Äôs parents lived, most babies who are detected to have this kind of disease while in the mother‚Äôs womb are aborted because even if they are born, babies will usually die in a few days. Theresa‚Äôs parents, being aware of their daughter&#x27;s situation and the law, decided and volunteered to donate baby Theresa‚Äôs organs to baby‚Äôs who are in dire need of organ transplants. But it is the law that prohibits the removal of organs while the donor is still alive. The law further states that taking organs will kill someone. Baby Theresa died after 9 days, and her organs had deteriorated and were worthless.</em></p><p id="f3c3f216-2073-46cb-8fc8-32359ea4359d" class="">Now, do you think Theresa‚Äôs parents&#x27; decision is moral? According to the argument from ‚ÄúWrongness of Killing<strong>‚Äù¬†</strong>it says that it is wrong to kill a person just to save another. In baby Theresa‚Äôs case, taking her organs would be killing her and saving¬†other people&#x27;s lives, therefore, taking organs is wrong.¬†However<strong>,¬†</strong>Rachels‚Äô argued on this theory. Here are his arguments:</p><p id="6a463b9c-7c0c-48e6-92c2-f500245984ab" class="">¬∑¬†Shouldn‚Äôt there be an exception to the rule?</p><p id="b5d5eee6-ae7c-4104-a466-43416de203fc" class="">¬∑¬†That baby Theresa is not conscious; in fact, she will never have a life, and she is going to die soon; that is from the medical point of view.</p><p id="f0482265-f6dc-40e4-b3cd-2010eae520fc" class="">¬∑¬†Should we regard baby Theresa as already dead?</p><h1 id="b1bfd4cd-e94d-43e8-8b0b-8d03687c3f77" class="block-color-blue">5. <strong>Topic 2: Ethics And Philosophy</strong></h1><h2 id="f0e2d859-9f40-41db-b9b3-f7a1d3e8b6be" class=""><strong>Ethics and Philosophy</strong></h2><p id="1961df54-c193-4527-ad50-a58b190b3df8" class="">One might ask, are ethics and philosophy related? If yes, what is the connection between these two terms?</p><p id="0b09237e-9e66-4e56-b534-5e6cde75110a" class="">In your previous lesson, you&#x27;ve learned that ethics serves as the guideline for human beings to lead a life that follows moral standards. But the question is, how sure we are that what we do is always right? This question will lead us to the fundamental nature of knowledge, reality, and existence- called &quot;philosophy&quot;.</p><p id="44b8ced0-0fc5-4248-a67b-1f694de81050" class="">Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle are the three major figures in ancient philosophy who considered ethics as a philosophical engagement. They were the ones who were able to see the possibility of thought and action or theory and practice that exist in dynamic unity.</p><ol type="1" id="660ccccc-1656-4c68-b867-b1d37a6ec780" class="numbered-list" start="1"><li><strong>Socrates</strong><p id="5abdc246-0db0-4b26-a714-14d52f9e2504" class="">On a day in 399 BC, the philosopher¬†Socrates¬†stood before a jury of 500 of his fellow Athenians who accused of &quot;refusing to recognize the gods recognized by the state&quot; and of &quot;corrupting the youth.&quot; If found guilty; his penalty could be death.</p></li></ol><ol type="1" id="9f8a72f0-3993-4961-a211-d59f33d3c96b" class="numbered-list" start="2"><li><strong>Plato</strong><p id="ab1ffe6a-40a7-4424-8545-b3b142bc5bd8" class="">He was Socrates‚Äô student who took over the task when He (Socrates) was executed for allegedly ‚Äúcorrupting the minds of the youth of Athens. ¬†Plato¬†discussed every kind of¬†philosophical¬†idea, including Ethics¬†wherein he enhanced the ethical orientation of philosophy by presenting human life as a struggle and what life is ought to be.</p></li></ol><ol type="1" id="379d1c14-fae5-4183-b556-7f00902807ea" class="numbered-list" start="3"><li><strong>Aristotle</strong><p id="023e79f1-c440-4420-8a21-aaf113e74ad4" class="">A student of Plato is a towering figure in ancient Greek philosophy, who made important contributions to logic, criticism, rhetoric, physics, biology, psychology, mathematics, metaphysics, ethics, and politics. His works include the necessity of finding one‚Äôs purpose and practicing moderation in life in order to achieve what we call¬†<em>eudaimonia¬†</em>which means¬†<em>happiness.</em></p></li></ol><p id="23b8dd48-de74-4ae9-86e3-e631a635f90b" class=""><em>N</em>ow, you might ask &quot;why ethics is philosophical?&quot;, The answer is that ethics emerges from our basic desire to make sense of the complexities of human conditions. Questions such as ‚ÄúWho Am I?‚Äù, ‚ÄúWhat Am I To Do With my Life?‚Äù, and ‚ÄúWho Do I Want To Be?‚Äù are all but expressions of the human need to understand oneself and be able to use such knowledge as a guide for actions.</p><h1 id="287ca4f1-bd5b-4909-9a4b-d1821a97f7c3" class="block-color-blue">6. Topic 3: The Importance of Rules to Social Beings</h1><p id="9fda8ec3-53aa-4dd8-bf0f-f82dd3c7ad91" class="">Are you familiar with the Golden Rule (GR) that goes: &quot;Treat others as you want to be treated&quot;. This adage becomes part of global ethics today. Let me share with you a well-known story about the Golden Rule. Here it goes:</p><p id="ba6b6e33-89a9-4b70-86b0-8914ab91c7ef" class="">There was once a family whose Grandpa was also living with them. Because of old age he can no longer hold things the way he used to do. While eating he dropped and broke his plate spilling the food, and was scolded and given a cheap wooden plate instead. Grandpa was so unhappy.
His grandson saw what happened and made two wooden plates. His parent saw what their young son was doing and asked him: &quot;Son what are you doing?&quot; The son replied: &quot;I&#x27;m making two wooden plates so that when you two grew old and must eat alone&quot;. His Mom and Dad looked sad and realized how they were mistreating Grandpa. So, they decided to let grandpa eat with them once more even Grandpa will spill his food again.</p><p id="d51a117a-f716-41db-80e2-8136e771b2b6" class="">The story is an example of Golden Rule. But be cautious of this Golden Rule because this does not apply all the time.  As a social being, we need to abide by the rules in a community where all of us belong in order to achieve a harmonious relationship. Rules are a clean set of guidelines for what we can do and we cannot do.</p><p id="e680513a-6444-4ba7-929f-90753a64e904" class="">Ethical standards serve as the guiding principles of human conduct. Doing what is right is the mantra in Ethics. But how sure we are that these actions are acceptable, especially to the people around us?</p><h3 id="5ca89289-1a91-4e36-b083-ae15ea1d18c7" class="">What are the different kinds of rules?</h3><p id="ecbceaa2-a2e9-4900-94b1-ef43389aba44" class=""><strong>As social beings, we have to act in accordance with the rules being imposed in the community where we belong.¬†</strong>Rules come in different faces.</p><p id="b511ae73-ad64-4bde-a025-0ba0314fa5f5" class="">Rules serve as the foundation for any healthy society.

Sartre (1957) tells of a student whose brother had been killed in the German offensive of 1940. The student wanted to avenge his brother and to fight forces that he regarded as evil. But the student‚Äôs mother was living with him, and he was her one consolation in life. The student believed that he had conflicting obligations. Sartre describes him as being torn between two kinds of morality: one of limited scope but certain efficacy, personal devotion to his mother; the other of much wider scope but uncertain efficacy, attempting to contribute to the defeat of an unjust aggressor.</em></p></li></ol><ol type="1" id="dcf9ac5d-582f-46d0-9382-265f981fb6ea" class="numbered-list" start="2"><li><strong>Organizational dilemmas</strong> - refer to ethical cases encountered by people in an organization.<p id="1a2bf23f-95d8-42a9-a1af-169604549346" class=""><em>The organizational dilemma is all about how to reconcile inconsistency between individual needs and aspirations on the one hand, and the collective purpose of the organization on the other.¬†Organizational dilemmas can take may different forms; from ethical through to toxic workplaces, it is important to be able to specifically define what the dilemma is and what is the root cause.</em></p></li></ol><ol type="1" id="84802f80-b585-4d89-973b-c0ee5e79ec18" class="numbered-list" start="3"><li><strong>Structural dilemmas</strong> - is wider in scope that involves cases of a network of institutions that encompass multi-sectoral organizations.
